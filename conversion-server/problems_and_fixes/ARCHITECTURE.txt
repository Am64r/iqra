JOB-BASED POLLING ARCHITECTURE
==============================

Problem: Long YouTube videos fail with "504 Gateway Timeout" errors because
Fly.io's HTTP proxy terminates connections after ~60 seconds.

Old approach: Single request waits for entire conversion before responding.
A 5-minute video takes 2-3 minutes to convert, exceeding the timeout.

New approach: Job-based polling with three endpoints:

  POST /jobs?url=...     → Returns job_id immediately
  GET  /jobs/{job_id}    → Poll status: pending/processing/completed/failed  
  GET  /jobs/{job_id}/download → Download MP3 when complete

Each request completes in <1 second. No timeout risk.

iOS client changes:
1. POST to /jobs to start conversion
2. Poll /jobs/{id} every 2 seconds until done
3. Download from /jobs/{id}/download
4. Show elapsed time during polling
